      <h3>Natal Chart Readings</h3>
      <p>
        I'm offering Natal Chart readings, where we look at the planets'
        alignment at the moment you were born. We will look at your strengths
        and weaknesses, possibilities, and possible challenges across topics in
        your life, such as health, career, love, and relationships. We will also
        check how the current cosmic weather is affecting you.
      </p>
      <h3>My Approach </h3>
      <p>
        My astrology is mostly rooted in traditional techniques but blended with
        modern elements. I focus primarily on the seven traditional planets: the
        <b>Sun, the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Venus, and Mars</b>, while
        still keeping an eye on the outer planets (
        <b>Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto</b>). I use only the five classical
        aspects and the whole sign house system.
      </p>
      <h3>The consultation</h3>
      <p>
        The ideal consultation would be more like a conversation. You let me
        know if what you are told rings true to you by sharing your background
        so that I can fine-tune the correct manifestations of the planetary
        placements in your chart. It's also important that you already come
        prepared with the topics you would like to discuss beforehand and any
        questions you have. For an accurate reading, it's essential to have your
        exact birth data. This includes your birthday, city of birth, and the
        precise time of birth. The birth time is usually available in your birth
        certificate. The consultation lasts from 60 to around 70 minutes. It is
        conducted by video call, preferably through Zoom or Skype. However, if
        you're based in Taiwan, a live consultation might be possible. If that's
        your case, please let me know.
      </p>
      <h3>Payment</h3>
      <p>
        I'm still an apprentice astrologer, so I'm offering my services at a low
        price since the consultations right now are an integral part of my
        training. The rates will go up naturally as I build a client base and
        acquire more experience.You can pay using Paypal.
